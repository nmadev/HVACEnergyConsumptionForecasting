Look at change in energy consumption by lower income communities!!!

* Multiple timestep unfolding
* Up-res images
* Masking part of data to fill in missing temp values
* Multi-channel CNN-LSTM with grid matching before the modeling step
* Increase overall resolution of the data
* Build a location search tool to see change in energy demand at that location
* Deploy web-app with search tool, projection builder, etc.
* Find heads per household by county and normalize for that
